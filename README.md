This app was inspired by one of my favourite toys: Spherical magnetic balls.

Using these magnets, I really enjoyed creating complex shapes and patterns

One of the issues when sharing these pictures was that it was hard to see the shape from different angles. Therefore, I created this interactive app which can display multiple designs in 3D!
